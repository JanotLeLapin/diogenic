Diogenic language reference

## Introduction

Diogenic is a language designed to write DSP patches as
S-expressions. It borrows a lot of its syntax from
[Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).

## Variables

Variables are initialized in `let` blocks:

```scm
(let
  (freq 440.0
   threshold (+ 0.5 (* 0.1 (sine! :freq 0.2))))
  (foldback threshold freq))
```

A `let` block must contain two children:

- the bindings: an identifier, value couple
- the expression: an expression that may reference defined variables

Values defined in the bindings section may reference previously
bound variables:

```scm
(let
  (mod-freq 220.0
   mod-phase PI
   mod (sine! mod-freq mod-phase))
  (...))
```

## Functions

Functions in diogenic are similar to macros in the way they're
implemented; function names are erased from the final instruction
sequence during compilation.

```scm
(defun my-saturation (in)
  (tanh (* 2.0 (foldback 0.75 in))))

(+ (my-saturation (sine! 220.0))
   (my-saturation (sine! 440.0)))
```

## Built-in devices

Pure devices only manipulate the diogenic VM stack. Impure devices
may also manipulate the state, a persistent f32 array. These are
marked by and exclamation mark (`!`).
