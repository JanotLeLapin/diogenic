## Demo

Diogenic is a DSP language/engine. It allows you to write patches as
S-expressions, and it compiles them to a performant instruction
sequence.

This snippet evaluates to a simple sinusoid wave oscillating at
440Hz. Try it out!

<Snippet doc={snippets[0].trim()} client:only />

A core idea of diogenic is modulation. We could replace 440 with
a deeply nested S-expression:

<Snippet doc={snippets[1].trim()} client:only />

Here, the frequency of the sinusoid varies between 440±110.
Notice the `triangle!` expression. This means the frequency will
smoothly interpolate between 330Hz and 550Hz. We could replace
it with a square oscillator instead:

<Snippet doc={snippets[2].trim()} client:only />

Try replacing `square!` by `sawtooth!` and see what happens!

Here's one last example:

<Snippet doc={snippets[3].trim()} client:only />

First, let's take a look at the declared bindings:

- `base`: `42.0`, the base MIDI pitch, a Fa#2
- `mod-freq`: the frequency at which the next LFO will oscillate
- `mod`: a LFO

We use these bindings to express a sinusoid oscillator.
Its pitch oscillates between `base - 6` and `base + 6`, so `36` and
`48`. We translate this MIDI pitch to a frequency with the
`(midi->freq)` function, and this gives us a silly-sounding patch,
Because the sinusoid frequency depends on an oscillator,
and the frequency of this oscillator also depends on an oscillator!

So that's just a quick example of how trivial it is to express
deeply modulated patches with diogenic. Please do check out the
[language reference](/diogenic/reference) and experiment!

## Why use diogenic

Diogenic is open source (licensed under GNU GPLv3) and easily
extensible. It's designed to make patches easy to read and
write for humans. I believe DSP tools should never be black
boxes that abstract away logic behind two or three knobs.
Artists gain artistic freedom by using patches that clearly
state their intent.
