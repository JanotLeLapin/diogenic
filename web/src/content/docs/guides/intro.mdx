import Snippet from '../../../lib/Snippet.svelte'

export const snippets = [
  `(sine! 440.0)`,
  `(sine! (+ 440.0
             (* 110.0
                (triangle! 0.2))))`,
  `(sine! (+ 440.0
             (* 110.0
                (square! 0.2))))`,
]

## Demo

Diogenic is a DSP language/engine. It allows you to write patches as
S-expressions, and it compiles them to a performant instruction
sequence.

This snippet evaluates to a simple sinusoid wave oscillating at
440Hz. Try it out!

<Snippet doc={snippets[0]} client:only />

A core idea of diogenic is modulation. We could replace 440 with
a deeply nested S-expression:

<Snippet doc={snippets[1]} client:only />

Here, the frequency of the sinusoid varies between 440±110.
Notice the `triangle!` expression. This means the frequency will
smoothly interpolate between 330Hz and 550Hz. We could replace
it with a square oscillator instead:

<Snippet doc={snippets[2]} client:only />

Try replacing `square!` by `sawtooth!` and see what happens!

## Why use diogenic

Diogenic is open source (licensed under GNU GPLv3) and easily
extensible. It's designed to make patches easy to read and
write for humans. I believe DSP tools should never be black
boxes that abstract away logic behind two or three knobs.
Artists gain artistic freedom by using patches that clearly
state their intent.
